## Abstract

This is meant as a fun exercise into the importance of securing your stuff. Your agility is important, but your stuff is [importanter](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Importanter).
Knowing about Linux systems and how to run inside them is essential, as [most systems have some kind of Linux distribution under their hood](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/85308/whats-the-approximate-percentage-of-linux-servers-in-the-world) and operational excellence is not an ops problem, but [the goal of the entire team](https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/992878988828721152).

This game is aimed at absolute beginners. Like any other [Jeopardy-style Capture The Flag game](https://www.reddit.com/r/securityCTF/comments/5nboxz/what_are_jeopardy_ctfs/), it’s organized in levels. You start at level 0 and at each level have to find the credentials for the next.


## CTF Readiness

Throughout our DevOps CoP sessions this quarter of 2020:
- We’ve talked about hardening servers and containers,
- Navigating the Linux terminal and filesystem,
- Using shell scripts to ease up our work,
- Understand basic networking concepts like DNS and SSH,
- And use them in our Linux systems
- And, finally, securing our containers and servers and showing what happens when we don’t (ಥ⌣ಥ)

## What do you need?

Make sure to bring your wits with you. If you get stuck, it’s perfectly fine. There are 7 days (no need to show this tape to someone else, fyi) and tons of resources available, like the help pages shipped with each Linux distro, the [DevOps CoP slide deck](https://github.com/3PillarGlobal/devops-cop), and, well, the entirety of the internet!
Remember, if you don’t know or remember something, [man](http://www.linfo.org/man.html) is your friend and --help is your trusted side-kick.

### Connection details
To access the server, create a Pull Request adding your SSH public key in the [public-keys](https://github.com/bogdanbarna/devops-cop-ctf-20q1/blob/master/public-keys/) directory.

After that has been approved and merged, connect to the 3PG VPN, you may access to the server and have fun:
```
ssh -i <your-private-key> fork1@ec2-3-121-184-179.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

To access the next level,
```
su - fork2
```
